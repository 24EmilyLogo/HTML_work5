            <p> 
                I want to be a game dev because I enjoy playing games and I want to bring stories and entertainment to other people.
                I like acting too but that's where I'm torn: 
                Do I want to make games and or do I want to do stuff with acting and film?
                I enjoy both programming and acting, heck that's why I've acted in Leigh's Haunt every year since sophmore year 
                (this year's theme is space and aliens). I just don't know how to apply both to what I'm doing.
            </p>

            <h2 style="color:#3c4c21; font-family:'Trebuchet MS';">College Plans</h2>
            <p>
                I plan to apply to Florida Polytechnic and the University of Tampa in Florida.
                I plan to apply to other colleges in Florida too but I don't know which ones yet. 
                If I don't get into either of those schools I'll go for a community college and transfer to either of the aforementioned colleges. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am looking into going into a Computer Science major or Film major.
                I enjoy programming as a job and hobby but I also like acting and filming videos.
                It's possible that I might double major both of these if I'm able to.
